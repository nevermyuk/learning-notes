## What do "DevOps " Engineers need to know?

- Systems Administration (Virtualization, Storage, Networking, Security)
- How web applications work (web servers, HTTP, client-side/server-side frameworks)
  - Understand HTTP Protocol ( Sending requests etc...)
  - Understand client/server-side framework (React,Angular,Node,ASP.NET) to be able to speak to a developer.
  - At least one programming/scripting language(Able to shell script)
  - Infrastructure as Code and Config Management (Cloudformation/Terraform)
  - Cloud Native Architecture (Containers, Orchestration)
  - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

## How to Create Your Own Learning Plan to Support Your Career Transition

- Determine your specific outcomes ( Setting a target, knowing where you want to work)
  - Look at the market and the job requirements
- Audit your current skill set (without judgement) 
  - Know your strength and witnesses
- Create a plan for filling in the gaps 
- Embrace a long term strategy

#### Tips

"Start" - The hardest part is just getting started. Pick a time, and topic, and start doing it ( not analyzing, Doing!!!).

Repeat - Do it again whether it is once a week,every other etc. Remember it's a marathon not a sprint.

## Sample Learning Plan

- Learn systems administration (**Server+,Linux+**,RHCSA,LPIC)
- Learn how to automate tasks with Python or Powershell scripts
- Learn how to start building Infrastructure Templates to deploy and manage a containerized web application 
  - Can be a basic web server in docker
- Store all of your scripts, Infrastructure template, and app code in a GitHub repo and learn how to deploy your app via CI/CD pipeline

## How to break into a DevOps Role... Even without Previous "DevOps" Experience

## It's simple...get in the game

- Build and contribute to open source projects
- Teach people what you're learning
- Start freelancing
- Find an internship
- Treat your career like a business
- You don't need anyone's permission to start now

#### Tips

"Treat the growth of your IT skills like trainign for a sport. Just like in sports,repetition is key"

Get your "time one the field" by using hands-on labs,online tutorials,or creating and contributing to github projects.

Set a goal for "IT practice" nights twice a week to train those DevOps muscles.

This is huge,especially if you are in a position where you do not get use those skills in your current job.

- Share what you're learning
- Pick up a 'DevOps' Certification
  - AWS/Google/Microsoft/DevOps Foundations

#### Tips

"Find your passion, then find your peers"

There's no better way to immerse yourself in DevOps than to fidn like minded people to interact with, bounce ideas off of ,find out what they're working on,ask and answer questions

And above all keep in mind: your first job as a DevOps engineer is to create value for your customer,so keep figuring out where it 'hurts' and start thinking about how to make it better!'

"Build a continuous learning mindset,look to apply everything you learn"

Automate repeated tasks,deploy a website with IaC, build a reference architecture in the portal, whatever it takes to practice!

Engage with your community, post what you learn,the value you add makes you visible.'

"Start with an imperative interactive language for automation. Powershell and Python are great examples. Use it to automate your daily tasks. Once you've mastered that start applying software development practices. Source control, continuous integration,continuous deployment,unit testing etc..."
